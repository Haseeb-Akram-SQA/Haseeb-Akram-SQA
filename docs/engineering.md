# Engineering Handbook

Welcome to the Engineering Handbook. This document outlines how we build, review, test, and ship software.

## Principles
- Pragmatic over perfect
- Small, frequent changes
- Automate what we repeat

## Tooling
- Repo: Haseeb-Akram-SQA
- Main branch: main
- CI: GitHub Actions (placeholder)

## Branching
- main is protected
- feature/<ticket-or-topic> for work
- Use pull requests for all merges

## Code Review
- Small PRs (<300 lines)
- At least 1 reviewer
- Describe context, approach, and tests

## Testing
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for critical flows
- Lint and format on CI

## Releases
- Merge to main triggers build
- Tag versions as needed
